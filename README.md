# chrome-for-testing-manager

Programmatic management of **chrome-for-testing** installations.

- Automatically resolves the requested version. `Chromedriver::run_latest_stable` is a shortcut for
  `Chromedriver::run(VersionRequest::LatestIn(Channel::Stable), PortRequest::Any)`.
- Automatically downloads chrome-for-testing `chrome` and `chromedriver` binaries into a local cache directory.
- Possibility to spawn the chromedriver process using a random port.
- Built-int session management.

Frees you from the need to

- manually download a chromedriver package matching your locally installed chrome,
- starting and stopping it manually,
- hardcoding the chosen chromedriver port into your tests and
- doing this all-over when trying to test with a new version of chrome.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
thirtyfour = "0.35"
chrome-for-testing-manager = { version = "0.6", features = ["thirtyfour"] }

# Additional dependencies for the example below.
assertr = "0.1"
anyhow = "1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Example

```rust
use assertr::prelude::*;
use chrome_for_testing_manager::prelude::*;
use thirtyfour::prelude::*;

// This library requires being used in a multithreaded runtime.
// If you want to run a test, use: `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]`.
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    Chromedriver::run_latest_stable()
        .await?
        .with_session(async |session| {
            // Navigate to https://wikipedia.org.
            session.goto("https://wikipedia.org").await?;
            let elem_form = session.find(By::Id("search-form")).await?;

            // Find element from element.
            let elem_text = elem_form.find(By::Id("searchInput")).await?;

            // Type in the search terms.
            elem_text.send_keys("selenium").await?;

            // Click the search button.
            let elem_button = elem_form.find(By::Css("button[type='submit']")).await?;
            elem_button.click().await?;

            // Look for header to implicitly wait for the page to load.
            session.find(By::ClassName("firstHeading")).await?;
            assert_that(session.title().await?).is_equal_to("Selenium - Wikipedia");

            Ok(())
        }).await
}
```
